</div>


<p><i>We having been Sufferers in this unfortunate
Voyage, had reason to believe,
from the Temper of our Captain, who
treated us barbarously both by Sea and Land,
that he would misrepresent the Matter, as
we now find he has done in a late Pamphlet
by him publish'd, intituled</i>, A Narrative
of the Sufferings, Preservation, and Deliverance
of Captain <i>John Dean</i>, and
Company, in the <i>Nottingham</i> Galley of
<i>London</i>, &amp;c. London, <i>Printed by</i> R. Tooky,
<i>and Sold by</i> S. Popping <i>at the</i> Raven <i>in</i>
Pater-noster-Row, <i>and at the</i> Printing Press
<i>under the</i> Royal-Exchange.</p>

<p><i>Our Apprehensions of this made us refuse
the Encouragement which was offered
us in</i> New England, <i>and resolve to come
home that we might have an Opportunity
to lay before the World, and before those
Gentlemen and others who have lost their
Estates and Relations in this unhappy Voyage,
the true Causes of our own and their
Misfortunes, and how they might, humanely
speaking, have been easily avoided, had Captain</i>
Dean <i>been either an honest or an able
Commander. This we think ourselves oblig'd
to do in common Justice, and to prevent others
from suffering by him in the like
manner.</i></p>

<p><i>We cannot but in the first place take notice
of a notorious Falshood he asserts in his
Preface</i>. That he might have had the
Attestation of several of his Fellow Sufferers
now in Town to the Truth of
what he has wrote, <i>since he very well
knows that Two of us did positively refuse it
in publick Company, after reading a part of
it, and told him to his Face</i>, that it was
not true.</p>

<p><i>In the next place, as to what he says of</i>
the Encouragement his Narrative met with
in <i>New England</i> and <i>North Britain</i>, where
it appeared under much greater Disadvantages
as to the Particulars and Dress,
<i>We think fit to reply, That the Acceptance
it met with in</i> New England <i>was occasion'd
by our being confined from appearing in publick
during our Sickness, and that he compell'd
us to sign what our Illness made us
uncapable to understand; but when it pleas'd
God that we recover'd our Health, and made
our Affidavits here subjoin'd before Mr.</i> Penhallow,
<i>a Justice of Peace, and Member of
Council at</i> Portsmouth <i>in the Province of</i>
New Hampshire, New England, <i>in the
Presence of the said</i> Dean, <i>who had not the
Face to deny it, his Character appear'd in a
true Light, and he was cover'd with Shame
and Confusion</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Captain has reason indeed to commend
the Charity of the Gentlemen of</i> New
England, <i>which is no more than their
due, both from him and us, tho' we were
unhappily deprived of the chief Effects of
it by the Captain's Brother; who being the
Person that received it, took care not to
be wanting to the Captain and himself,
whereas we had nothing but what was fit
for such miserable Wretches, who were glad
of any thing, since we were then uncapable
of working for better.</i></p>

<p><i>As to what he says in his Postscript about
Insurance, we know nothing further of that
matter than what we heard on Board, as
will appear by our Narrative, viz.</i> That
there were great Sums insured upon the
Ship, <i>the truth of which is more proper for
the Inquiry of others than us who are only
Sailors.</i></p>

<p><i>We come now to the Narrative, wherein
we shall represent nothing but the Truth,
of which we our selves had the Misfortune
to be Witnesses, to our great Sorrow, and
the manifest Danger of our Lives.</i></p>

<p><i>And since what we deliver is upon Oath,
we hope it will obtain Credit sooner than the
bare Word of Captain</i> Dean, <i>his Brother,
and Mr.</i> Whitworth, <i>who were all Three
interested Persons, and but One of them acquainted
with all the Matter of Fact, which
for his own Reputation and Safety he has
been obliged to set off in false Colours.
Besides, Mr.</i> Whitworth <i>is since dead, so
that the Captain has no Vouchers but himself
and his Brother; and how little Credit
they deserve will sufficiently appear by
what follows.</i></p>

<h2 id="THE_NARRATIVE"  class="nobreak">THE NARRATIVE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The <i>Nottingham-Galley</i> of 120
Tons, 10 Guns, and 14 Men,
<i>John Dean</i> Commander, took in
part of her Lading in the River <i>Thames</i>,
which was Cordage, and the rest in Butter
and Cheese, at <i>Killybags</i> in <i>Ireland</i>. But
Captain <i>Dean</i> in his Narrative has omitted
to acquaint the World that 4 of the
Guns were useless, and that not above 6
of the Men were capable to Serve in the
Ship, in case of bad Weather. She Sail'd
from <i>Gravesend</i> the 2d Day of <i>August</i>,
1710. to the <i>Nore</i>, and from thence on
the 7th, with 2 Men of War, and several
Merchant-Men under their Convoy, towards
<i>Scotland</i>. When we came off of
<i>Whitby</i>, the Fleet brought to, and several
of the Ships were a-stern. We having a
fine Gale, the Captain said he would Run
it, and make the best of his way for <i>Ireland</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
which we did. And when we were
on that Coast, the 12th of <i>August</i>, we saw
2 Ships in a Bay, towards whom the
Captain would have bore down, but the
Men would not consent to it, because they
perceiv'd them to be <i>French</i> Men of War.
Upon this we stood off to Sea till 12 at
Night; when the Captain coming upon
Deck, we Sail'd easily in towards the
Shore, by the Mate's Advice, till Daylight,
and came so near Land that we were
forced to stand off. The next Day we saw
the two Privateers again, and the Captain
propos'd to stand down towards them, or
to come to an Anchor; but the Mate and
the Men oppos'd it. The Captain was seconded
in this by <i>Charles Whitworth</i> the
Merchant, who said in the hearing of the
Boatswain, and others, <i>That he had rather
be taken than otherwise, tho' he had an
Eighth Part of the Ship, because he had Insured</i>
200 l. And the Captain said, <i>He had
rather run the Ship ashore than perform his
Voyage, if he thought he could be safe with
the Insurers, because his Brother had insur'd</i>
300 l. <i>upon her</i>. Accordingly he put in
towards the Shore, to find out a proper
Place for that purpose, and ordered the
Boatswain to get the Tackle upon the Boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and hoist her overside, that she might be in
readiness to go ashore. At the same time
the Captain and <i>Charles Whitworth</i> went to
the Cabbin to get out the best of their
Goods in order to carry them with them;
and putting them up in a Chest, commanded
the Men to carry them into the Boat,
which they did. The Captain promis'd
that we should want for nothing, and resolv'd
to go ashore; so that we all plainly
saw he was resolv'd to lose the Ship. But
he was opposed by the Mate <i>Christopher
Langman</i>, who wrought the Vessel through
between the Main and an Island, and she
arriv'd safely at <i>Killybags</i> in <i>Ireland</i> that
same night.</p>

<p>We took in the rest of our Lading there
the 25th of <i>September</i>, being 30 Tons of
Butter, and above 300 Cheeses, and sail'd
for <i>Boston</i> in <i>New-England</i>; which we were
very uncapable to do, because the Captain,
by his barbarous Treatment of our
Men, had disabled several of 'em, and
particularly two of our best Sailors were
so unmercifully beat by him, because they
oppos'd his Design abovemention'd, that
they were not able to work in a Month.
This gave us a very melancholy Prospect
of an unfortunate Voyage, since we perceiv'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
he would either lose the Ship, or
betray her to the <i>French</i>, because she was
insured for much above the Value. Besides,
he put us to short Allowance, so that
we had but one Quart of Water <i>per</i> Head
in twenty four Hours, and had nothing to
eat but salt Beef, which made us so dry
that we were forc'd to drink the Rain
Water that run off the Deck. And the
Captain was so barbarous that he knock'd
down one of our Men for dead, because
when he found the Hold open, he went
and drew a Gallon of Water to quench our
Thirst. In the mean time he wanted nothing
himself, tho' he pretended to us that
he confin'd himself also to short Allowance,
yet we knew the contrary.</p>

<p>When we came to the Banks of <i>Newfoundland</i>
we saw a Ship which made all
the Sail she could towards us, and soon
came up with us. The Captain and Mr.
<i>Whitworth</i> hoping she was a <i>Frenchman</i>,
put on their best Apparel, and gave us
as much strong Beer and Brandy as we
could drink: But it prov'd to be the <i>Pompey</i>
Galley of <i>London</i>, Captain <i>Den</i> Commander,
at which we rejoic'd, tho' our
Captain was melancholy. We continu'd
our Course towards <i>New England</i>; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the first Land we made was <i>Cape Sables</i>,
which is about 50 Leagues from <i>Boston</i> in
that Country.</p>

<p>We made the best of our way for that
Port, but the Wind blew hard, so that
we were several Days without sight of
Land, and were forced to hand all our
Sails, and lie under our Mizzen-Ballast till
Daylight; when the Boatswain having the
Morning Watch discover'd Land to the
Leeward, with which he acquainted the
Captain and the Mate, who both came
upon Deck. The Captain said that was
the first Land we had made, wherein he
was justly contradicted by the Mate, which
caus'd some Words between 'em: For
in Truth we made Cape <i>Sables</i> a Week before;
and if we had kept our Course then,
according to the Opinion of the Mate and
Ship's Company, we had, in all Probability,
arriv'd safe the next Day at <i>Boston</i>, but
the Master laying the Ship by, and the
next Day proving moderate Weather, and
the Wind coming to the West, we stood
away to the North, and so it was a Week
before we made Cape <i>Porpus</i>, which was
the same Day we were lost; so untrue is it
what the Captain says, that the first Land
we made was to the East of <i>Piscataqua</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
After those Words had pass'd with the
Mate, the Captain went down to serve us
with Water, according to Custom, and in
the mean time the Captain's Brother took
a Bottle of Water from the Mate, and
struck him; upon which the Captain
coming out of the Hold, he took up a Perriwig
Block, with which he came behind
the Mate, and struck him three Blows on
the Head, upon which he fell down and
lay as dead for several Minutes, all in
Blood. This was very discouraging to
the Seamen, who durst not speak to him
for fear of the like Treatment. Soon after
this barbarous Action we perceiv'd
the Ship in Danger by being so near Land;
upon which the Boatswain being on the
Watch call'd the Captain, and the Mate,
who being scarce recovered came on the
Deck all in Gore, and told the Captain
he had no Business so near the Land, except
he had a Mind to lose the Ship, and
therefore desir'd him to hawl further off,
or else he would be ashore that Night.
The Captain answer'd, <i>That he wou'd not
take his Advice though the Ship should go to
the Bottom, threatned to shoot the Mate
with a Pistol</i>, and told him, <i>he would do
what he pleas'd except they confin'd him to</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<i>his Cabbin</i>. It fell out according as the
Mate had said; we run ashoar that Night,
being the <i>11th</i> of <i>December</i>, between 8
and 9 a Clock, when the Ship struck upon
<i>Boon Island</i>, a Rock three or four Leagues
East from <i>Piscataqua</i>. And here the Captain
is false again in his Narrative, when
he says <i>p.</i> 2. <i>that he saw the Breakers ahead,
upon which he call'd out to put the Helm
hard on the Starboard</i>; for he was then
undressing himself to go to Bed, according
to his usual Custom. When the Ship
struck, the Boatswain told the Captain, <i>he
had made his Words good, and lost the Ship
on purpose, whereas had he taken the Mate's
Advice, he might in all probability have
been safe at</i> Boston <i>Ten Days before</i>. The
Captain bid him hold his Peace, <i>He
was sorry for what had happen'd, but we
must now all prepare for Death, there being
no Probability to escape it</i>. Upon this several
of our Men went on the Deck, but
cou'd not stay there, because the Sea broke
in all over the Ship. Then the Captain,
who had been Cursing and Swearing before,
began to cry and howl for Fear of
losing his Life. The Boatswain and another
went into the Hold to see if there
was any Water there, and finding there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
was, we went all into the Cabbin to Prayers,
being in hopes the Ship would lie
whole till Daylight. Soon after this the
Mate, though hardly able, went with some
others above Deck; for this Surprize made
him forget his Pain. He spoke to the
Captain, and told him, <i>It was his Business
to encourage the Men, and not to dishearten
them</i>: Yet still he insisted it was impossible
for us to save our Lives. However,
the Mate with three others cut down the
Main-Mast and Fore-Mast, which by God's
Assistance prov'd the Means of our Preservation;
for the Fore-Mast fell on the Rock
with one End, and the other rested on
the Ship. The Mate went afterwards into
the Cabbin, and desired the Captain to
use his Endeavours to save the Men, for
the Ship would immediately sink, and it
was not time to think of saving any thing,
but to get ashore as light as we cou'd. By
this Time the Water came out of the
Hold, and the Sea beat over the Deck, so
that there was no standing upon it. The
Mate got first on the Mast, and with great
Difficulty escap'd to the Rock. He was
follow'd by two others, who likewise got
on Shore, but were scarce able to stand
on the Rock, from whence they hallow'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to us to follow them, and we not hearing
them any more than once, were afraid
they were wash'd off by the Waves. This
put us into a mighty Consternation, so that
we knew not whether it were best to follow
them, or to stay on board till it was
Day. The Captain was for the latter;
but it being dead low Water, the Tide
of Flood coming on, and the Wind beginning
to blow hard, the Sea beat into
the Cabbin while we were at Prayers,
which forced us to go upon Deck: Some
more of our Men escap'd to the Shore by
help of the Mast, as the others had done,
and call'd to us to make haste and follow
them, which we did, and by the Blessing
of God got safe to the Rock, though not
without much Danger, being forced to
crawl upon our Hands and Knees we were
so heavy with Water, and the Rock so
slippery.</p>

<p>Here again the Captain is false in the
second Page of his Narrative; for he neither
call'd us down to Prayers, nor order'd
us up again, nor did he either command
or assist at cutting down the Mast. We
know not whom he points at, where he
says, several of the Company did so sink
under Racks of Conscience, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
were not able to stir; for he himself had
as great Reason to be under Terror of Conscience
as any Man, since he was the
Cause of all our Misfortunes. Accordingly
he cryed heartily, and begg'd the Mate
to do what he cou'd to save us, for he
himself cou'd do nothing. Nor was the
Captain ever upon the Deck but once,
when he held by the Long-Boat, cryed
out, and presently went down again,
which greatly discouraged us, so that had
it not been for the Mate, <i>&amp;c.</i> who cut
down the Shrowds, <i>&amp;c.</i> as abovemention'd,
we had all perish'd. He is also unjust
to the Mate in his third Page, where
he says, <i>That one of the Men went out on
the Boltsprit, and returning, told the Captain
he saw something black ahead, and would
adventure to get on Shore, accompanied with
any other Person</i>; upon which the Captain
pretends he desired some of his best Swimmers,
the Mate and one more, to go with
him, and if they recover'd the Rock, to
give Notice by their Calls, and direct the
rest to the most secure Place; for it was
the Mate who went on the Boltsprit and
discover'd the Land. After which he desired
the Captain and the rest to go ashore
before he attempted it himself; but finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
them all dead-hearted, the Mate, who
cou'd not swim, as the Captain alledges,
got on Shore by the Mast as abovemention'd.
The Captain is also false in asserting
that he attempted to save his Money,
Brandy, Ammunition, <i>&amp;c.</i> for our Relief,
since he had not the Value of one Guinea
aboard in Money. It is equally false that
he tore his Arms and Fingers in such a
lamentable manner in climbing up the
Rock; for not one Man was hurt in getting
ashore. Nor was the Captain in danger
of being wash'd off from the Yard, the
Water there being no deeper than our
Middle.</p>

<p>When we got ashore we found it to
be a desolate small Island, without any
Shelter; and being wet, and having but
few Clothes, some began to despair of
being able to live there till the Morning;
and besides, we were not certain but it
might be over flow'd at high Tide. We
comforted our selves however, the best
we cou'd, and though we expected to perish
there, return'd God Thanks for giving
us some more Time to repent. In this dismal
Condition we continued till next Morning,
without any thing to refresh us: But being
in hopes that the Wreck would remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
till Daylight, and that we might
recover some of our Provisions, we sent
a Man down to see what was become of
her, but he brought us Word that he
cou'd see nothing of her. When Daylight
came we went to look for the Wreck
in a cold and hungry Condition; but
found nothing except one half Cheese,
entangled in a Piece of a Rope, and
this we equally distributed among us.
Soon after we found a Piece of fine Linnen
and Canvas, of which we endeavour'd
to make a Tent, and effected it at
last by the help of the Boatswain the second
Day, and this preserv'd us from being
all frozen to Death, as our Cook was
in a little Time to our very great Grief,
since we look'd upon it as a certain Presage
that we should all have the same
Fate. We carried the Corpse to the Seaside,
from whence it was soon wash'd off
by the Flood. Here the Captain publishes
another Falshood in his fifth Page, when he
says <i>he knew where he was</i>; for he declared
to us that he knew not: Nor is there any
more Truth in the Compassion he there
alledges that he shew'd to the Cook when
he was a dying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Weather clear'd we discover'd
the main Land, which we suppos'd
to be about a League from us. This
fill'd us with Hopes that by the Providence
of God we should soon be deliver'd,
for which we return'd him Thanks, and
immediately set about building a Boat
out of part of the Wreck which was
drove ashore, and heartily pray'd, that
God would give us Success. We were
so cold, hungry and feeble, that it was
scarce possible for us to do any thing, nor
could we walk on the Rock in order to
keep us warm, it was so craggy, uneven
and slippery. We made shift however to
finish our Boat, the Bottom of which was
made of Three Planks, and the Side was
Half a Plank High. We cork'd and lin'd
it with Canvas the best we could, and
made it about Twelve Foot Long and Four
Foot Wide, thinking it sufficient to hold
Six of us.</p>

<p>After this some Controversie happen'd
who the Six should be. The Carpenter
pleaded his Right to be one, because he
built it; the Captain pleaded to be another,
which was agreed to; and the Boatswain
was thought fit to be one, because
he spoke the <i>Indian</i> Language; but at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
it was concluded that the Mate, the Captain's
Brother, <i>Charles Whitworth</i>, and
<i>George White</i>, should be the Men; and
we carried the Boat to the Shore, where
we launch'd her, putting on Board such of
the Carpenter's Tools as we had sav'd
from the Wreck, in order to build a better
when we came on Shore. We begg'd the
Assistance and Direction of God, and some
of our Company went into the Boat, taking
leave of the rest, and promising to
bring them Relief as soon as possible. But
the Boat overset, by which our Men were
almost drown'd, and narrowly escaped
again to the Rock. The Boatswain held
the Boat almost an Hour with a Rope in
hopes to save her till the Weather grew
more calm, and the Gunner came to his
Assistance, but soon after she was stav'd
to pieces, which was a great Mortification
to us. We thank'd God however that
he was pleas'd again to preserve so many
of us, tho' the Time for our Relief was
not yet come. The Captain is out in his
Account, <i>pag. 7.</i> when he says, our Boat
had a Mast and a Sail, for she had neither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The Wind blowing hard, and there
being a great Snow, we betook our selves
to Prayer, and earnestly begg'd that God
would have mercy on us, and consider
our deplorable Condition. Being wet
with our Endeavours to launch the Boat,
our Cloaths freezed to our Backs, which
proved fatal to our Carpenter, who died
a few Days after. The next Day prov'd
fair Weather, so that we could see the
Houses on the main Land, and several
Boats rowing to and fro, which rejoyc'd
us very much; and after praying that
God might direct some of them to us, we
shew'd our selves on several Places of the
Rock, and hallow'd to them, but they
could not hear us. This quite discourag'd
us again, for we had no Provisions but
some small pieces of Cheese, four or five
pieces of Beef, and one Neats Tongue
that we recover'd out of the Wreck, and
a small quantity of this was distributed among
us every Morning when we went
round the Rock to see if it would please
God to send us any further Provisions. At
last <i>George White</i>, one of our Number,
found some Muscles at Low Water, for
which we return'd God Thanks, and we
found about as many for two or three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
as six or seven came to each Man's share;
but the Weather was so cold, and the
Tides fell out so late in the Night that we
could get no more. The Captain then
told us, <i>We must shift for our selves, there
being nothing now for us to trust to but the
Mercies of God</i>. There being a piece of
a Cows Hide on the Fore Yard of the
Wreck, we cut it into small pieces and
swallow'd it down, which reviv'd us a
little. Some of our Company got Sea
Weed, which was also shar'd among us,
and this was all the Entertainment we had
for several Days; but still we liv'd in
hopes of being deliver'd from this dismal
Place; and the Captain told us, <i>If we were,
he would sell the Cables, Anchors and Guns
that were cast ashore, for our Maintenance</i>.
In this Distress our Mate perceiving
a large Sea Gull in a Hole of the Rock,
he knock'd it down with the Handle of
a Sawce Pan, brought her into the Tent,
and shar'd her among us, to our great Relief.</p>

<p>Perceiving no hopes of any Boats coming
to us, a stout <i>Dutchman</i>, one of our
Company, propos'd the making of a Raft,
and proffer'd to endeavour to get ashore
with it himself, if no body else would.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
This Proposal being well relish'd, such of
us as were able clear'd the Fore Yard of the
Rigging with a great deal of Trouble, for
want of sufficient Strength and necessary
Instruments; and having split it in two to
make the Sides of the Raft, and fastning the
End pieces with Nails, we put a Plank in
the Middle, with a Mast, and a Sail made of
two Hammocks, and accordingly launch'd
her, with <i>George White</i> and the <i>Dutchman</i>
upon it, giving them Orders, if they
got ashore, to acquaint the People with
our Distress, and to beg their hastening
to our Assistance. But the Raft overset,
by which the Men were almost drown'd,
so that none would venture upon it again
except the <i>Dutchman</i> and another. We
pray'd heartily for their Success, and saw
them paddle along till the Sun was down,
and they appear'd to us to be so near the
Shore, that we hoped they might Land
safely.</p>

<p>That Night it blew very hard, and the
next Day our Carpenter died as abovemention'd,
and in the Morning we hawl'd
him out of the Tent. That same Day the
Captain and <i>George White</i> went out to see
what they could find, but return'd empty
handed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this the Captain propos'd the
fleying and eating of the Carpenter's dead
Body, and told us, <i>It was no Sin, since God
was pleas'd to take him out of the World and
that we had not laid violent Hands upon
him</i>. He ask'd the Boatswain to help to
skin and cut him up, which he refus'd
because of his Weakness; whereupon one
<i>Charles Gray</i> help'd the Captain to do it,
and brought in several pieces of the Corps
into the Tent, where some of our Men eat
of it; but the Mate, the Boatswain, and
<i>George White</i> would not touch any of it till
next Day that they were forced to it by
Extremity of Hunger.</p>

<p>Here the Captain is guilty of several
Heads, and particularly <i>pag. 11</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> for
he was so far from offering to go ashore
on the Raft, that he said, <i>Let who will go,
'twas all one to him</i>. Nor did the <i>Dutchman</i>
or <i>Swede</i> ever desire the Captain to
go with him or help him to turn the Raft;
nor did the Captain assist <i>George White</i> to
get ashore when he was overset in the
Raft. It is likewise false, that the other
Man who went off in the Raft was found
dead with a Paddle fastned to his Wrist,
for his Corps was found about 300 Yards
from the Shore, and no Paddle to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Wrist. 'Tis likewise false, that the Captain
went several times out alone to look
for Provisions, for <i>George White</i> was always
with him. Nor is it true, that the piece of
Cow's Hide beforemention'd was brought
into the Tent by the Captain's Order, for
<i>George White</i> brought it without his
Knowledge. It is likewise false, that the
Men first requested the Carpenter's dead
Body of the Captain to eat, for he himself
was the first that propos'd it, and the
Three Deponents refus'd to eat any of it
until the next Morning that the Captain
brought in some of his Liver and intreated
'em to eat of it; so that the Captain's
Pretensions of being moved with Horror
at the Thoughts of it, are false, for there
was no Man that eat more of the Corps
than himself. It is likewise false, that any
of the Men removed the dead Body from
the Place where they laid it at first. It is
also untrue, that the Captain order'd
his Skin, Head, Hands, <i>&amp;c.</i> to be buried
in the Sea, for these we left on the Island
when we came off. Nor is there any more
Truth in the Care which the Captain ascribes
to himself, in hindring us to eat
too much of the Corps lest it should prejudice
our Health, for we all agreed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Night before we come off, to limit our
selves, lest our Deliverers should be detain'd
from coming to us. And as to our
Tempers being alter'd after the eating of
humane Flesh, as the Captain charges us,
<i>p. 16.</i> we can safely declare, that tho' he
says, <i>There was nothing to be heard among
us but brutish Quarrels, with horrid Oaths
and Imprecations</i>, all the Oaths we heard
were between the Captain, his Brother,
and Mr. <i>Whitworth</i>, who often quarrel'd
about their Lying and Eating. And
whereas the Captain often went to Prayers
with us before we had the Corps to eat, he
never, to our hearing, pray'd afterwards,
but behav'd himself so impiously, that he
was many times rebuked by the Mate and
others for profane Swearing.</p>

<p>Having agreed with the Men we sent
off on the Raft, that they should kindle a
Fire if they got safe on Shore, we were
rejoic'd upon the sight of a Smoke, hoping
that had been the Signal they promis'd,
but it was not. Soon after that we perceiv'd
a Boat coming towards us, which
made our Hearts leap for Joy, and we
return'd Thanks to God for the Prospect of
a speedy Deliverance. The Boat came to
an Anchor along the side of the Rock, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
could not get ashore; and we call'd to 'em
for Fire, which the Master sent us by one
of his Men in a small Canoe, but no Provisions.
This was the 22d Day after we
had been on this desolate Rock, so that
the Man was frighten'd at the sight of so
dismal a Spectacle. We all got about
him, and cryed for Joy. He told us,
that the Reason of their coming to the
Rock to see for us, was their finding a Raft
on the Shore, with one Man frozen to
Death about Two or Three Hundred
Yards from it, but they heard nor saw
nothing of the other, from whence 'twas
supposed that the Man found dead ashore
having landed there in the Night Time,
and not knowing where to go, he was
frozen to Death under a Tree where
they found him. After this Discourse, our
Captain went to go off in the Boat, but
it overset, so that we were forc'd to take
up the Canoe, and carry it all over the
Rock, to seek for a smooth Place to put
her off again, which we did after the
Man had staid with us Two or Three
Hours. He promised to come with a better
Boat to carry us off, but lost his Vessel
as he came near the Shore, and narrowly
escaped with his own and his Mens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Lives; upon which he sent an Express
to <i>Piscataqua</i> for Relief to us. This Night
we had a prodigious Storm, but kept a
great Fire, which was seen on the Shore,
and prov'd very comfortable to us, both
for its Warmth, and by Broiling Part of
the Dead Corps, which made it eat with
less Disgust.</p>

<p>The next Day it blowed very fresh,
so that no Relief could come to us; but
on the 4th of <i>January</i> in the Morning, the
Weather being fair, several Sloops came
towards us, and one Canoe came ashore
with Four Men, Two of which were
Captain <i>Long</i> and Captain <i>Forbe</i>, Commanders
of Ships, and soon carried us all
off on board their Vessel; for several of
us had our Legs so frozen, and were so
weak that we could not walk. These
Gentlemen took great Care of us, and
would not suffer us to eat or drink but a
little at a time, lest it should do us hurt.
Night we arrived at <i>Piscataqua</i> in <i>New
England</i>, where we were all provided
for, and had a Doctor appointed to look
after us. We were Ten who came ashore.
Two of us having died on the Island, and
Two being lost that were sent off on the
Raft. The Names of those that were sav'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
are <i>John Dean</i>, Captain; <i>Christopher Langman</i>,
Mate; <i>Christopher Gray</i>, Gunner; <i>Nicholas
Mellan</i>, Boatswain; <i>George White</i>,
<i>Charles Whitworth</i>, <i>Henry Dean</i>, <i>Charles
Graystock</i>, <i>William Saver</i>, and the Captain's
Boy, who had Part of his Foot
cut off to prevent a Mortification, and several
others were lame. Thus we were
delivered by the Goodness of God (for
which we praise his Name) after we had
been Twenty Four Days upon that Desolate
Island in the Distress abovementioned,
having nothing to shelter us but a sorry
Tent that could not keep us from wet,
and was once in Danger of being carryed
off by the high Tide, which obliged us
to remove it to the highest Part of the
Rock. We had nothing to lie on but
the Stones, and very few Cloathes to cover
us; which, together with our Hunger,
made our Lives a Burden to us.</p>

<p>Some Days after our Arrival, the Captain
drew up a Protest, which was sign'd
by the Mate, being then very ill of a Flux
and Fever; and also by the Boatswain
<i>Geo. White</i>, who was also ill, and declared
that he did it for fear of being put out
of his Lodgings by the Captain, while he
was both sick and lame. But as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
as the Deponents recover'd, they declar'd
the Captain's Protest to be false, <i>&amp;c.</i> as
may be seen by the Depositions hereunto
annex'd.</p>

<p>The Captain falsly ascribes to himself,
<i>p. 17</i>, the first Discovery of the Sloop that
came to relieve us, whereas it was first
discover'd by <i>Christopher Gray</i>, the Gunner,
he being sent out on purpose by the
Mate, who the Night before had dreamt
of the Sloop's Arrival. The Captain likewise
falsly magnifies his own Danger of
being drowned, when the Canoe was overset,
since the Water then was scarce
half a Yard deep; and instead of being
thankful to God for his own and our
Deliverance, he returned with the Dog to
his Vomit, and behav'd himself so brutishly,
that his Friend Captain <i>Purver</i> was
obliged to turn him out of his House.
He was so little sensible of the Merciful
Deliverance from the Danger he had escaped,
that he barbarously told the Children
in his Lodging, he would have made
a Frigasy of them if he had had 'em in <i>Boon
Island</i>; which frighten'd the People that
heard him, and made them esteem him
a Brute, as he was. He likewise wrong'd
us of what the Good People gave us towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
our Relief, and applyed it to his
own and his Brother's Use; and particularly
when Captain <i>John Wentworth</i> gave
several of our Men good Cloaths, Captain
<i>Dean</i> came and order'd them the
worst that could be had, and was likewise
so barbarous as to get us turn'd out
of our Lodgings, before we were able to
shift for our selves.</p>

<p>All this we avouch to be Truth, and
have no other End in publishing it, but to
testify our Thankfulness to God for his
Great Deliverance, and to give others
Warning not to trust their Lives or Estates
in the Hands of so wicked and brutish
a Man.</p>

<p>For the Truth of what we have deliver'd,
we refer to the Affidavits subjoined,
which we made concerning this Matter
both in <i>New England</i>, and since our Arrival
at <i>London</i>.</p>

<h2  class="nobreak"><i>An Account of our intended
Voyage, and some Accidents
that happen'd therein from
the River of</i> Thames <i>to</i> Ireland,
<i>in the</i> Nottingham-<i>Galley</i>,
John Dean <i>Master</i>.</h2>
</div>

<p><i>August</i> the 7th, 1710. we sail'd from
the <i>Nore</i> in company with her Majesty's
Ship <i>Sheerness</i>, she then being appointed
a Convoy for the <i>North Britain</i> Fleet,
which we parted from off of <i>Whitby</i>, and
made the best of our Way.</p>

<p>The 21st <i>ditto</i> we saw two Sail, and
that they gave chace to us, they being to
the Leeward of us about Three Leagues.
It being then the Master's Watch on the
Deck, he called the Mate, and told him,
<i>That he saw Two Privateers</i>. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the Mate came on the Deck, he desired
the Master to run in Shore to the Windward
of the Island of <i>Arran</i>, we then being
about Two Leagues to the Windward
of it. But the said Master would have
gone in to Leeward, which we could not
have done without speaking with the aforesaid
Ships; and he proposed it several
times; but the Mate nor none of the
Ship's Company would consent to it, but
told him, <i>That if he did, we could not possibly
escape the Enemy</i>. <i>Charles Whitworth</i>
then said in the hearing of the Boatswain
and some others of the Ship's Company,
<i>That he had rather be taken than not, for
he had Two Hundred Pounds Insured</i>; he
having an Eighth Part of the Ship, as he
said.</p>

<p>The Master the next Day would have
gone ashore and left the Ship, and put a
Chest and several other things in the Boat.
The Mate told him, <i>That he would not consent
to any such Thing, for he then saw no
Danger of being Taken</i>, and told the said
Master, <i>That it was early in the Morning, and
but Seven Leagues from our Port, and a fair
Wind to run along the Shore</i>. The said
Master was then heard to say by the Boatswain
and several of the Ship's Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<i>That if he thought the Insurance would be
paid, he would immediately run her ashore</i>.
So that we all plainly saw that he was
willing to lose the said Ship. The Mate told
him, <i>That if he would, by God's Assistance
he might fetch his Port before Night, if he
would make Sail; but he had a Design to
give the Ship away, he might</i>. The said
Master found the Mate was not willing
to what he proposed, and that he could
not obtain his Desire, he made Sail, and
about Six or Seven in the Evening we arrived
at our desired Port <i>Killybags</i>, where
we took in 30 Tons of Butter and 300 and
odd Cheeses.</p>

<p><i>September 25, 1710.</i> we sail'd from this
Port, bound for <i>Boston</i> in <i>New England</i>.</p>

<p><i>December 11, 1710.</i> we being then on
the Coast of <i>New England</i>, and close on
Board of <i>Cape Porpus</i>, the Mate told him,
<i>That he did not know any business we had so
nigh the Shore, and that it was his better
way to hawl further to the Southward</i>. The
said Master would not take his Advice if
the Ship went to the Bottom.</p>

<p>At or about Eight this Morning the said
Master came to the Mate and knock'd him
down with a Block, such as Barbers make
Wigs on. We all thought that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
kill'd him, for he lay dead some time,
and lost a great deal of Blood.</p>

<p>Between Eight and Nine this Night the
Ship run ashore, the Wind at E. S. E.
and a moderate Gale. The Mate being
then in his Cabbin, and hardly done bleeding,
got on the Deck, tho' badly able, and
ordered the Masts to be cut away, which
we did, and by God's Assistance got all
ashore, it being a desolate Land, about
Three Leagues from the Main. We then
steer'd W. and by S. so that if we had
miss'd it we should have run ashore on
the Main. This Island is called by the
Name of <i>Boon Island</i>. We remained on
it Twenty-four Days, and suffered a great
deal of Hardship; at which time we were
fetched off by a <i>Piscataqua</i> Boat, and carried
ashore.</p>

<p>Some Days after the Master drew up a
Protest, which the Mate and Boatswain
signed, the Mate being then very ill with
a Flux and Fever, and the Boatswain and
<i>George White</i> declares, That the Protest
was false, and hardly a Word of Truth
in it, but for fear of being put out of his
Lodging, he then being very Sick and
Lame, sign'd it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the Mate recover'd, we all
and every of us declare, and give our
Oath, That this is the real Truth, and the
said Master's Protest to be false; which
we now before the Worshipful Justice of
the Peace disavow and give our Oaths,
That this is the Truth and that if the
said Master had taken the Mate's Advice,
the Ship, with God's Assistance, might
have been in <i>Boston</i> Harbour several Days
before she was lost.</p>

<p>Christopher Langman, Nicholas Mellin,
<i>and</i> George White, <i>personally appeared before
me the Subscriber, one of Her Majesty's
Justices of the Peace at</i> Portsmouth <i>in the
Province of</i> New Hampshire <i>in</i> New England,
<i>and Member of Council within the
same, this 9th Day of</i> February, 1710-11.

written, Captain</i> Dean <i>at the time of
taking this Oath being present</i>.</p>

<p  class="names">

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Christopher Langman</i>, late Mate of the
late Ship called the <i>Nottingham</i>, of
the Burden of about 120 Tons, whereof
<i>John Dean</i> was Master, <i>Nicholas Mellon</i>
Boatswain, and <i>George White</i> Sailor, all
belonging to the said Ship, do severally
make Oath as followeth, <i>viz.</i> And first,
the said <i>Christopher Langman</i> for himself
saith, The said Ship being designed on a
Voyage from <i>London</i> to <i>Killybags</i>, and from
thence to <i>New England</i>, she departed from
the <i>Nore</i>, the 7th of <i>August</i>, 1710. in company
with her Majesty's Ship <i>Sheerness</i>,
which they left off of <i>Whitby</i>. That on
the 21st of the same Month they saw Two
Sail to the Leeward, which gave chace to
the said Ship <i>Nottingham</i> for about the
Space of Three Leagues; in which time,
(notwithstanding this Deponent told the
said <i>Dean</i> they were Enemies) he often
would have bore down upon them; that
the Day fallowing they saw the Privateers
again, when the said <i>John Dean</i> (contrary
to the Will of this Deponent) would have
brought the said Ship <i>Nottingham</i> to an
Anchor; which if done, she would in all
probability have been taken. That they
then left the said Privateers, and arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
with their said Ship that Night at <i>Killybags</i>
aforesaid, where they deliver'd what
Goods were thereto consigned. That on
the 25th Day of <i>September</i>, in the Year
aforesaid, they departed with the said
Ship <i>Nottingham</i> from the said Port for
<i>Boston</i> in <i>New England</i>. In Prosecution of
which Voyage, being on the Coast of <i>New
England</i>, the said <i>John Dean</i>, without any
Provocation, came to this Deponent and
knock'd him down after a very barbarous
and inhumane manner, and between Eight
and Nine of the Clock at Night of the
same Day, the said Ship <i>Nottingham</i> was
run on Shore on the Coast of <i>New England</i>,
(contrary to the Advice of this Deponent)
where she, with the chiefest Part of her
Cargo, was utterly lost. And lastly, This
Deponent believeth, that the said <i>John
Dean</i>, according to his Working of the
said Ship in the said Voyage, design'd to
lose her.</p>

<p  class="names">
<i>Christopher Langman.</i><br />
</p>


<p>And the said <i>Nicholas Mellin</i> for himself
saith, That the several Allegations,
Matters and Things contained in the aforegoing
Deposition of <i>Christopher Langman</i>,
are just and true in every Particular thereof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
And this Deponent saith, That at the
Time they were chased by the said Privateers
he was present, and did hear Mr.
<i>Charles Whitworth</i> (then on board the said
Ship, and adjudged Part Owner thereof)
say, <i>That he would rather the said Ship
should be lost than obtain her design'd Port
in Safety, having made 200 l. Insurance</i>. And
this Deponent saith, <i>That the said</i> John
Dean <i>at the same time declared, That his
Brother</i> Jasper Dean <i>had made 300 l. Insurance</i>;
and immediately after said, <i>If he
thought he could secure the Insurance, he
would run the Ship on Shore</i>; and upon the
same order'd this Deponent to hoist the
Boat over the Side of the Ship, which
done, the said <i>John Dean</i> put therein all
his valuable Effects, with a Design to run
the said Ship on Shore, but was prevented
by the Deponent <i>Christopher Langman</i>,
by whose Assistance the said Ship arrived
at her Port of <i>Killybags</i>, and having reloaded
departed for <i>Boston</i> in <i>New England</i>,
upon which Coast making the Land, the
Deponent being on the Watch, call'd up
the said <i>John Dean</i>, and told him there was
Land just to the Leeward of them, and the
Deponent <i>Christopher Langman</i> being call'd
up also, desired the said Ship might be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
off from the Shore, which the said <i>John
Dean</i> refus'd <i>if she went to the Bottom</i>; and
for the said <i>Langman's</i> Advice threatned
to fetch up a Pistol and shoot him, and
did go down, and came up behind him
and knock'd him down with a Loggerhead,
by means whereof he lay dead for
several Minutes, and the same Night the
said Ship <i>Nottingham</i> run ashore upon a
desolate Rock, and was stav'd in Pieces;
And this Deponent saith, <i>That if the Ship
had missed that Misfortune, she would have
run ashore on the Main Land</i>, which he believes
was the Master's Design: And on
the said Rock we should have been lost
our selves, had not the Mate <i>Langman</i>,
who was then bleeding and cutting down
the Mast (under God) sav'd our Lives;
in which Island the Cook was frozen to
Death, and the Carpenter dying next having
been reduced to Hunger, the Master skinned
him and cut him up, and they eat
him, when Two of the Ship's Company
went on Shore on a Raft; one of which
was never heard of, the other was found

<p>And the said <i>George White</i> for himself
saith, That on the <i>7th</i> of <i>August 1710</i>,
they departed with the said Ship <i>Nottingham</i>
from the <i>Nore</i>, on the Voyage to <i>Killybags</i>
and <i>New England</i>, that in Prosecution of
the Voyage on the <i>21st</i> Day of <i>August</i>, in
the Year aforesaid, there appear'd off the
Coast of <i>Ireland</i> two Ships to the Leeward,
to which the said <i>John Dean</i> would have
bore down, but that the Deponent <i>Langman</i>
and the Men believ'd they were Privateers,
and advis'd to the contrary, and
would not consent to his bearing down.
And this Deponent saith, That Mr. <i>Charles
Whitworth</i>, then on board the said Ship,
and said to be a Part Owner thereof, declared,
That he had rather be taken than
not; and the next Day the said Master
<i>John Dean</i> would have run the said Ship
<i>Nottingham</i> on Shore, provided he thought
the Insurance would be paid, and then declared
his Brother had 300 <i>l.</i> assured, and
<i>Mr. Whitworth</i> 200 <i>l.</i> assured, and, so put
out some Goods into the Boat (which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
then in the Tackle) to save, altho the Deponent <i>Langman</i>
and the Men declared the said Ship was within so
small a way of her Port, and might escape, which she
did accordingly. That after her departure from <i>Killybags</i>,
when she came on the Banks of <i>Newfoundland</i> was
chaced by the <i>Pompey</i>. Captain <i>Den</i>, at which the said
<i>John Dean</i> and Mr. <i>Whitworth</i> seem'd to rejoice, believing
him a Privateer; but proving otherwise, they appeared
disappointed. That when they came on the Coast of
<i>New England</i>, falling in with Cape <i>Porpus</i>, the Mate and
the Men declared that it was not convenient to stand
in for the Shore, but to bear away to the Southward.
That upon some Words arising <i>John Dean</i> with a Perriwig
Block struck the Mate <i>Christopher Langman</i> Three
Blows on the Head, which made him lie bleeding.
That the same Day the said Ship <i>Nottingham</i> was run
ashore upon a most desolate Island, call'd <i>Boon Island</i>,
(which had they miss'd they must have run ashore on
the main Land in a few Hours, which makes this Deponent
believe in his Conscience the said Ship was designed
to be lost) where the Men had been lost had not
the Mate, who was then bleeding, came on Deck, and
the Mast being cut down, under God saved their
Lives. In which Island one of their Company, being
the Cook, died, and the Carpenter dying next, they
being reduced to Hunger, eat him, when Two of the
Ship's Company went on Shore with a small Rafter,
one was never heard of, the other was found dead in
the Woods, by which the Country understanding a
Wreck, came off with a Canoe, whereby they had
Fire after the 22d Day, by which they broil'd the rest
of the Man until the 24th Day after their being on the
Island before relieved.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
